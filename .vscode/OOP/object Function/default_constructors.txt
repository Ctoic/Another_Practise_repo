Now lets understand the type of constructors in C++
Let suppose you went to a shop to buy mobile ,there are three scenerios
1.you go to the shop and just say that I want a moble without specifying 
the name and other attrbuutes. He will give you the mobile which is mostly sold
,hence this s example of default constructors
2. You went to the shop and now you are specifying name colour and everything you want in 
your moble phone. like you said i need i phone 12 black colour he will 
provide the phone accordinglly. THis is parametrized function.
3.You went to the shop this time you are holding a mobile phone in your hand and you 
say bruv i need a phone like this ,yoou show the phone physcally to the mobile
seller. He will provide the same mobile in your hand. So i hope that you understood what I am 
trying to convey.
===============Parametrize Constructor==========
--> parametrized constructor is a constructor hich takes arguments to iitialze the objects
we have to jusst pust argument in the constructor like we do in any other functions

--> When you define body of the constructor define use parameters to initialze the objects;
--> it is used to initialze different data elements of different object with different values when they are created
--> it is used to overload constructors
..> yeah we can overload a constructor


============Copy Consructors==============
--> A copy constructor is the member function which initialize an object using 
another object of the same class.
-->Whenever we define one or more non-default constructors( with parameters ) for a class, 
a default constructor( without parameters ) 
should also be explicitly defined as the 
compiler will not provide a default 
constructor in this case. However,
it is not necessary but itâ€™s considered
to be the best practice to always define
 a default constructor. (Copy paste from GeekForGeeks)
